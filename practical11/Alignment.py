random sequence and mouse sequence 13 5.8558558558558556%
mouse sequence and human SOD2 protein sequence 199 89.63963963963964%
random sequence and human SOD2 protein sequence 12 5.405405405405405%
interpretation:
By comparing the three, we found that human and mouse sequences were the most 
similar, possibly because they came from the same ancestor.
